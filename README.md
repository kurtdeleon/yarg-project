# yarg-project

This game was made in Processing. Run yarg-project-ardu if you want the version that has Arduino controls integrated. yarg-controls.ino has the Arduino stuff. Do remember you have to rename the folder to whatever processing program you run.

Badly needs optimization. The beatmaps won't be read perfectly on all machines. This was my first go at making a working rhythm game.

Works for Processing 3.3.5 and above. Works for Arduino 1.8.2 and above.
